# Fraud Transaction Detection with Random Forest Classifier 
## Objective:
The main objective of this project is to detect fraudulent transactions using a Random Forest Classifier. The implementation involves data preprocessing, feature selection, model training with hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation using metrics like ROC curve analysis and confusion matrix.

## How the code works:
Please refer to the attached 'Project Description' PDF for details.

## How to Run the Code:
- First, download the dataset from Kaggle using this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).
- After downloading, update the dataset path in the 'FraudTransactionDetection_RFclassifier.ipynb' code.
- This project uses external libraries such as TensorFlow, scikit-learn, pandas, and NumPy. Please ensure these libraries are installed before running the code.
