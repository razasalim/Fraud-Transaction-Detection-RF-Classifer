# Fraud Transaction Detection with Random Forest Classifier 
## Objective:
The main objective of this project is to detect fraudulent transactions using a Random Forest Classifier. The implementation involves data preprocessing, feature selection, model training with hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation using metrics like ROC curve analysis and confusion matrix.

## How the code works:
Please refer to the attached 'Project Description' PDF for details.

## How to Run the Code: 
- First, we need to doanload dataset from Kaggle [link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud] then  need to add the path 'FraudTransactionDetection_RFclassifer.ipynb' code
